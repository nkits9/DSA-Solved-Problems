# GeeksForGeeks-Solved-Problems

I have solved quite number of problems from GeeksOfGeeks on several topics, the solution to problems are highly optimised and concise.

This repository can be used as help for those who are new to competitive programming.

The code is merely a snippet (as solved on GFG) & hence is not executable in a c++ compiler.


## How to contribute?

```bash
1. Fork the repository 
2. Do the desired changes (add/delete/modify)
3. Make a pull request
```

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
